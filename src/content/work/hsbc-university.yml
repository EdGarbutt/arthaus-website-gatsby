          - "HSBC set us the challenge of updating how ‘Learning’ was branded, structured, positioned,                     communicated and delivered throughout the business. HSBC University was the result, bringing                     together the many varied learning areas from across the business, including Leadership, Risk,                     Strategy & Performance into a structured and easily accessible brand."
          - "The visual brand brings this all to life and was created to be distinctive, flexible and easy                     to implement across all media whilst adhering to the tight HSBC brand guidelines."
