          - "Simpson Spence Young, the world’s largest independent shipbroker, commissioned Arthaus to create                     a new brand identity for the business that would build on their heritage whilst reflecting the fact                     that this is very much a 21st century business. The brand design included creating brand guidelines,                     a new corporate brochure and redesigning the web site. "

          - "Hand car wash specialist Waves approached Arthaus to build a bespoke app that could                     be used to check cars in while monitoring their progress through the wash process.                     The system also needs to allow for real-time monitoring of the daily output from each                     of its 250+ sites. The app was designed to be simple to use and is delivered through                     the Apple App Store."
          - "The app has been extremely successful and continues to be developed with a new Trade                     Account section and an Employee Compliance sub-site being recently launched to ensure                     all sites comply with Home Office employment laws. "
